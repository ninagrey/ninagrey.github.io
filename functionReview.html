	function is an action, you can put things inside of it. When you "call it" or "run it" it does the things.
	<br><br>
	You can define and specify what your function does so that it does specific things (like changing specific traits or characteristics of an element on the page)
	<br><br>
	sometimes when we want to run a function on the whole document we say document.___... when we want to do this wiht a dic we say it's id then it's style and then the attribute to change - we usually put these things inside themselves (e.g. box.style.opacity = "0")
	<script type="text/javascript">
	addEventListener("click", function(){})

	setInterval() // makes a function run every time interval that you set//

	createElement() //make a div or link or whatever you ask it to make //

	classList.add() // adds a aclass to an element we've created//

	console.log()
	alert()

	play() // plays an audio file - use audio file id//
	pause() // ppause an audio file - use audio file id//

</script>
